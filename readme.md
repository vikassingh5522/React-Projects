## üí° Possible Improvements

* Add a top-level README with a list of projects + clickable links & live previews/screenshots.
* Include sample input/output or screenshots for each project.
* Standardize project structure (each mini-project having README.md explaining what it does).
* Add deployment (Netlify / Vercel) links if deployed.
* Add unit tests or quality checks for more mature projects.
